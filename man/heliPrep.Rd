\title{Prepare Data for Helical Plotting}
\usage{
heliPrep(dates, values, window_size = 7, span_x = 0.7, span_y = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{dates}{A vector of dates associated with the values; can be numeric or
Date objects. If numeric, they are treated as days since a given start date.}

\item{values}{A numeric vector of the time series values corresponding to the dates.}

\item{window_size}{The size of the moving window to calculate the moving average.
Defaults to 7.}

\item{span_x}{Unused.
Represents the proportion of data points influencing each smoothed value.
A number between 0 and 1; higher values make the smoother follow the data more closely.
Defaults to 0.7.}

\item{span_y}{Unused.
Similar to `span_x` but for the rate of change. Defaults to 0.7.}
}
\value{
A data frame suitable for helical plotting, containing the original
  dates, the smoothed values (`ch_avg`), the smoothed rate of change (`ch_rate`),
  and the endpoints for plotting (`yend`, `xend`).
}
\description{
This function preprocesses a time series data for helical plotting by
applying a moving average and smoothing the values and their rate of change.
It also handles conversion of numeric dates to Date objects and ensures
proper alignment of the time series for plotting.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assume 'dates' and 'values' are available time series data
  prepared_data <- heliPrep(dates, values)
  # Now 'prepared_data' can be used for helical plotting with 'heliPlot'
}

}
